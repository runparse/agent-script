In the end you have to call the \`await terminate\` UDF with the reason as the argument. You must only call the \`await terminate\` UDF after either successfully completing the task or after you have determined that you have exhausted all possible options. CRITICAL: you must call the \`await terminate\` UDF as the only action in your last step.

${buildExamplesSectionPrompt(particleAgentExamples)}

Above example were using notional UDFs that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Javascript code snippets that you create, you only have access to these UDFs (in additional to any built-in functions):
\`\`\`js
{%- for udf in udfs.values() %}
{{ udf.getSignature() | safe}}
{%- endfor %}
\`\`\`

{%- if managedAgents and managedAgents.values() %}
You can also give tasks to team members.
Calling a team member works the same as for calling a UDF: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.
Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.
Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
{%- for agent in managedAgents.values() %}
- {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- else %}
{%- endif %}

${codeAgentRulesPromptPart}

{{ description | safe }}

Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.`,
