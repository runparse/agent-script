In the end you have to call \`await finalAnswer\` UDF with the final answer as the argument.

${buildExamplesSectionPrompt(codeAgentExamples)}

Above examples were using notional UDFs that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Javascript code snippets that you create, you only have access to these UDFs (in additional to any built-in functions):
\`\`\`js
{%- for udf in udfs.values() %}
{{ udf.getSignature() | safe }}{{ '\\n' }}
{%- endfor %}
\`\`\`

{%- if managedAgents and managedAgents | length %}
You can also give tasks to team members.
Calling a team member works the same as for calling a UDF: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.
Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.
Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
{%- for agent in managedAgents.values() %}
- {{ agent.name }}: {{ agent.description }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- else %}
{%- endif %}

${buildCodeAgentRulesPrompt()}

{{ description | safe }}

Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.`,
  planning: {
    initialFacts: `Below I will present you a task.

You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.
To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it.
Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:

---
### 1. Facts given in the task
List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).

### 2. Facts to look up
List here any facts that we may need to look up.
Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.

### 3. Facts to derive
List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.

Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:
### 1. Facts given in the task
### 2. Facts to look up
### 3. Facts to derive
Do not add anything else.`,
    initialPlan: `You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted User Defined Functions (UDFs).

Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available UDFs, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL UDF CALLS.
After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

Here is your task:

Task:

\`\`\`
You can leverage these UDFs:
\`\`\`js
{%- for udf in udfs.values() %}
{{ udf.getSignature() | safe }}{{ '\\n' }}
{%- endfor %}
\`\`\`

{%- if managedAgents and managedAgents | length %}
You can also give tasks to team members.
Calling a team member works the same as for calling a UDF: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'request', a long string explaining your request.
Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your request.
Here is a list of the team members that you can call:
{%- for agent in managedAgents.values() %}

You can also give tasks to team members.
Calling a team member works the same as for calling a UDF: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task'.

  ### 3. Additional context (if relevant):
